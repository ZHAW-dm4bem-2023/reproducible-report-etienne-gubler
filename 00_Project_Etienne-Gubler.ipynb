    "# Comparing the simulation of a single thermal circuit to the simulation of a thermal circuit assembled from multiple sub networks\n",
    "**Summary:**\n",
    "- The heat transfer in **two connected rooms** is modeled using a thermal circuit.\n",
    "- This **thermal circuit** is implemented **as a single network and** also **as** a combination of **multiple sub networks**.\n",
    "- Then the **mathematical model as a system of differential algebraic equations (DAE)** is obtained for both versions of the thermal circuit.\n",
    "- The systems of DAE are transformed into **state-space representations** to allow the thermal circuits to be simulated.\n",
    "- The **simulation** is then performed **using the Euler methods** (both explicit and implicit) for numerical integration.\n",
    "- In the end, **the outcome of the two simulations is being compared**. This is done to **ensure, that the result of a simulation does not depend on the method** that is used to create the thermal circuit (using either a single or an assembled network).\n",
    "- Both simulated thermal circuits model the same physical components and **should** therefore **lead to identical results**.\n",
